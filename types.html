 <p3>There are 3 types of Programming which are used in todays society.</p3>
 <h2>Prodcedural Programming</h2>
 <p1>Procedural programing are imperatives and functions that use many procedures that are combined within the main program. To make the program simpler, sub procedures are used which run as sequential control structures when the program is being run by the user.  Procedural programming is very simple to understand as the actual program runs in a sequential/imperative way and it only requires a keyboard which means it is easy to use as it doesn’t have any events such as clicking.</p1>
<br>
<h2>Examples of a procedural programming languages are:</h2>
<p1>Basic- which is a high level third generation language. The language “Basic” stand for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code which is very easy to use for people who have no experience of programming. This high level language only gets used for the teaching of the fundamentals of programming for users who want learn coding. This was mainly used in the 1980’s. However, during this present time, they are used to produce applications for businesses.</p1>
<p1>Java- which is also a third generation high language of programming that constructs software for multiple platforms. When the programmer encodes an application written in java, it gets compiled so it can run on operating systems, such as Windows, Linux etc. it is very a popular language currently 
as it is very easy to understand and use. Java is mainly used for mobile applications to create apps mainly on Android operating systems so it can run it can run on other devices. Also java is used for apps as technology is far more advanced therefore there will be a wider community of developers who want to give their input to apps which they and other people of the society will use.</p1>
<br>
<h2>Object orientated programing </h2>
<p1>Object orientated Porgramming is based upon programming objects with certain commands such as walking around and making sounds. This type of programming is done in classes as it’s much easier to edit and change certain elements of code. </p1>
<br>
<h2>Examples of object orientated programming languages are:</h2>
<p1>Java-Information written above the heading!</p1>
<br>
<p1>C#- which is is a fifth generation low level language which was created by Microsoft and capable of doing many types of programming such as procedural, object orientated and event driven.It also has code editors, debuggers and interface designers in order for programmers to develop their program and applications.C# is used for creating NET applications on a NET Framework where you create, develop and debug applications which you can develop in the NET. There are many different types of applications which can be made such as web and client sever apps, gaming using the engine unity, creating programs in a console, class libraries and windows form application.</p1>
<br>
<h2>Event Driven Programming</h2>
<p1>Event-Driven Programming is a visual and an interactive type of programming that triggers an event which has occurred due to the users input e.g. clicking /hovering menu option.The interface for event driven programs is more user friendly than imperative and procedural programs. Event driven programs usually have a GUI interface because the controls used in the interface can be used as in Windows to trigger routines in the program code sub-procedures.</p1>
<br>
<h2>Examples of Event-driven languages: </h2>
<p1>C#-Information written above the heading!</p1>
<br>
<p1>JavaScript-which is a third generation high level language that was introduced in 1995 and is used the creation of web pages to carry out events also the behaviour of websites such as button clicking typing and hovering which appears on the web browser along with the HTML and CSS.</p1>
