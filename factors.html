 <p1>There are certain factors which every programmer in the world have consider whether its for a client or for personal use. These factors are:</p1>
 <h2>Organisational Policy</h2>
 <p1>In any working organization there are certain rules and regulations which have to be followed when using hardware and software. For example, when you are picking a programming language to create software that can only be used on a windows 10 software and hardware the programing language that has been chosen has to support windows 10 e.g. C# and C++. </p1>
<br>
<h2>Suitability in terms of available features and tools</h2>
<p1>During the stage of creating software a suitable language will need to be chosen to suit the needs of the program. For example, if you are making new hotel app you may use C# as it has a variety of features and tools such as debugging and editing tools.</p1>
<br>
<h2>Availability of trained staff</h2>
<p1>In any organization there has to be trained and available staff at all times so that they can deal with any software programming issues which the user is finding difficult to solve. For example   If the programmer is working on a project where they have to create system and the organisation needs to recruit  the right person , the organisation will employ a person who is more familiar with the language as they will be considered as  experienced software designers in the used language by the programmer. </p1>
<br>
<h2>Reliability</h2>
<p1>All languages have features that enable every programmer to consider the reliability of their program, as different languages have similar features of the varieties of the programming paradigms. For example, thereâ€™s debugging and developing features that prevents errors and prevents the software from crashing</p1>
<br>

<h2>Development and Maintenance costs</h2>
<p1>The organisation has to consider the finance of the software for example the cost of software license is and the duration of the software usage.</p1>
<h2>Expandability</h2>
<p1>Expandability is key when choosing a programming language as it enables the programmers to create a program which numerous users can use without any problems for example C++ can be updated quicker than the higher level languages such as FORTRAN.</p1>
