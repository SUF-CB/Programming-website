 <p3>There are 5 Generation languages which are broken down into two categories.The first category are known as "Low Level Languages " which are languages that are dependent on a machine and as it only uses instructions in the form of binary numbers 0 and 1 that get sent to the hardware.The second language category is known as "High Level Languages" which are langauges we use today to program a variety of things that dont use the hardware. Therefore the langauges are more user friendly and easy to code,debug and maintain.</p3>
 <br><br><br>
<p1>1. The first generation languages, or 1GL, are low-level languages that are machine Languages which utilizes machine code called Binary. E.g. Assembly language </p1>
<br><br><br>
<p1>2. The second-generation languages, or 2GL, are also low-level assembly languages. They are sometimes used in operating systems and hardware drives, but more commonly used for video editing and video games.</p1>
<br><br><br>
<p1>3. The third-generation languages, or 3GL, are high-level languages, such as C# and JavaScript.</p1>
<br><br><br>
<p1>4. The fourth-generation languages, or 4GL, are languages that consist of statements similar to statements in a human language. Fourth generation languages are commonly used in database programming and scripts examples include  PHP, Python,  and SQL.</p1>
<br><br><br>
<p1>5. The fifth-generation languages, or 5GL, are programming languages that contain visual tools to help develop a program.</p1>
